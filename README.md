# Introduction

**Introduction**

AMRIT (Accessible Medical Records via Integrated Technologies), developed by Piramal Swasthya, is a cutting-edge digital health platform designed to transform the healthcare landscape in India. As an integral part of national initiatives like ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission), AMRIT enables seamless access to health records, ensuring better care delivery through data-driven insights. Our platform connects beneficiaries, healthcare facilities, and frontline health workers in a unified, technology-driven ecosystem, aiming to improve healthcare outcomes and service efficiency across the country.

#### **What We Do**

At AMRIT, we empower the Indian public health system by digitizing healthcare delivery, focusing on primary care, telemedicine, and integrated health services. Our platform supports the creation of ABHA (Ayushman Bharat Health Account) IDs, enabling secure, consent-based access to patients' medical histories across diverse healthcare systems. By ensuring a robust digital infrastructure, AMRIT bridges the gap between healthcare providers and patients, facilitating continuity of care and expanding access to comprehensive health data.

With a focus on both preventive and curative healthcare, we enhance service delivery efficiency, promote frontline worker empowerment, and strengthen the integration of national health programs. Our impact spans 16 states, with over 26 projects and 46 health facilities, managing more than 2 crore health records and benefitting millions of individuals through our outreach programs.
